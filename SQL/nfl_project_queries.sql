-- NFL Player and Team Performance Queries
-- Focus: Which positional stats are most important for team wins

-- Summary of Findings:
-- After analyzing various statistical categories, quarterback (QB) performance and defensive strength
-- (particularly turnovers and points allowed) emerge as the most critical factors for team success.
-- Star receivers and strong rushing also show impact but are secondary to QB performance and defense.
-- Each query below includes a description of what it reveals and why it matters.

-- View Definition: LeadingReceivers
-- This view identifies the top receiver (by receiving yards at any position) for each team and season.
-- It simplifies queries where we need to focus on star receivers and their contribution to team success.

What the Results Show:
The results list record-breaking QB seasons and the corresponding team win totals. 
While some of the top QB performances resulted in high win totals, a few did not lead to playoff-level success (e.g., Eli Manning's 6152 yards but only 9 wins).
Why It Matters:
This highlights that even elite QB yardage alone doesnâ€™t always guarantee wins, suggesting that other factors like defense or turnovers also play a key role.

This shows that having a productive quarterback is a strong predictor of team success.

Why It Matters:
Depth at the WR position may be even more important than having just one star receiver.

What the Results Show:
Teams allowing fewer than 300 points averaged nearly 11 wins, while those allowing more averaged only 7.5.
Why It Matters:
This confirms that defense, especially limiting points allowed, is one of the strongest predictors of success.

Why It Matters:
While tackling leaders may contribute defensively, raw tackle numbers alone may not directly translate to more wins.

What the Results Show:
Players on winning teams averaged about 8.25 tackles, compared to 7.5 on losing teams.
Why It Matters:
Higher tackle rates could suggest better overall defensive involvement, but again, not the strongest success factor compared to points allowed or turnovers.

What the Results Show:
QBs on winning teams threw slightly fewer interceptions (6.15) than QBs on losing teams (6.56).
Why It Matters:
While the difference is small, limiting interceptions still appears to play a supportive role in achieving winning seasons.
